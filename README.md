* Use tools like Excel, Power BI, Tableau, or Google Sheets to import the cleaned data for visualization.
* Build charts, graphs, and tables to compare KPIs such as averages, strike rates, yearly trends, and performance in different match situations.
* Interpret the visuals to draw meaningful conclusions and present insights on player contributions, strengths, and trends.
